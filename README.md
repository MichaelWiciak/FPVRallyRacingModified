# FPVRallyRacingModified
Contains the code that I wrote and modified to teach programming for the FPV Rally Racing Course at TechCamp

1. Download the general Arduino Software using the Google Drive Link found in "General Link To Arduino Portable MW version.txt". I might have already done this for you. 

2. Go into Arduino Portable Folder -> Portable -> Sketchbook -> FPV

3. Delete the existing Transmitter and Receiver Folders since they contain the default code I wrote. If you wish to start from scratch, use the default files. Otherwise, do the steps below. 

4. Paste Transmitter and Receiver Folders there. There are 5 example folders which contains different functionalities for the button and steering wheel screen. Pick one and try to upload it to your car/steering wheel. Then you can program custom moves yourself. 

5. Enjoy the coding :)


Any problems, please email me back and I will sort it.
