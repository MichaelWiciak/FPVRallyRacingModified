# FPVRallyRacingModified
 Contains the code that I wrote and modified to teach programming for the FPV Rally Racing Course at TechCamp

1. Download the general Arduino Software using the Google Drive Link found in "General Link To Arduino Portable MW version.txt"

2. Go into Arduino Portable Folder -> Portable -> Sketchbook -> FPV

3. Delete the existing Transmitter and Receiver Folders since they contain the default code I wrote. If you wish to start from scratch, use the default files. Otherwise, do the steps below. 

4. Paste your personal Transmitter and Receiver Folders there.

5. Enjoy the coding :)


Any problems, please email me back and I will sort it.
